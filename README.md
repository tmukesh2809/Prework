## User Stories

The following **required** functionality is complete:

The following **optional** features are implemented:

* [x] UI animations
* [ ] Remembering the bill amount across app restarts (if <10mins)
* [x] Using locale-specific currency and currency thousands separators.

The following **additional** features are implemented:

- [ ] List anything else that you can get done to improve the app functionality!

## Notes

Describe any challenges encountered while building the app.
- Getting the dark mode to be persistant across all the viewControllers was something that I struggled with.
- My computer was getting heated a lot.
- Getting used to a new style of coding with swift.
